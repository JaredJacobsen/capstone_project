For the NETL algorithm you will need to download an LDA package. The matlab code provided has been designed to work with the package written by Daichi Mochihashi, available at:
http://chasen.org/~daiti-m/dist/lda/

The files you will need to make sure are in this directory are:
accum_beta.massert.mconverged.mdiff_vec.mfeatures.mfmatrix.misint.mldamain.mmnormalize.mnewton_alpha.mnormalize.mrtime.mvbem.m

In addition, you will also need to train your LDA topic model with an LDA package to obtain the *.alpha and *.beta parameter files. See the main ReadMe for more details.
